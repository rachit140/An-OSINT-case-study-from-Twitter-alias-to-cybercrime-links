# An-OSINT-case-study-from-Twitter-alias-to-cybercrime-links
An OSINT report describes an online persona, @sp1ritfyre. The persona has suspected links to an MSP breach and sales of credentials. Findings come from social media, forum posts, metadata along with open-source tools. The report shows the investigative work.

# OSINT Investigation: @sp1ritfyre

## Overview
This repository contains an open-source intelligence (OSINT) case study on the Twitter persona **@sp1ritfyre**, believed to be associated with a hacking group involved in compromising a Managed Service Provider (MSP) and selling stolen credentials. The project demonstrates how publicly available data can be collected, analyzed, and documented for investigative purposes.

---

## Objective
- Build a profile of the online persona using OSINT techniques.
- Identify evidence linking the individual to MSP breaches and credential sales.
- Showcase investigative workflow and documentation for educational purposes.

---

## Key Findings
- **Social Media Activity:** @sp1ritfyre interacts with hacking communities and amplifies content related to exploits and leaked credentials.
- **Alias Correlation:** A similar alias, `spiritfyre_`, was observed on forums advertising “fresh MSP creds.”
- **Metadata Insights:** Images and posts suggest a European time zone (CEST) and English (UK) language settings.
- **Open-source Tools:** Analysis included reverse-image searches, forum monitoring, and searching for code snippets or configuration files related to credential access.

> Note: This is a fictional scenario for learning OSINT techniques. No real person is implicated.

## Workflow
1. Identify the target social media accounts.
2. Analyze posts, interactions, and activity patterns.
3. Cross-reference usernames on forums, paste sites, and GitHub.
4. Extract metadata from publicly shared files or images.
5. Document findings and link patterns that suggest cybercrime involvement.
